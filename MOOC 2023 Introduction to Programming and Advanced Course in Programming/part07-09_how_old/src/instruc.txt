Please write a program which asks the user for their
date of birth, and then prints out how old the user was
on the eve of the new millennium. The program should ask
for the day, month and year separately, and print out the
age in days. Please have a look at the examples below:

Sample output
Day: 10
Month: 9
Year: 1979
You were 7417 days old on the eve of the new millennium.
Sample output
Day: 28
Month: 3
Year: 2005
You weren't born yet on the eve of the new millennium.
You may assume all day-month-year combinations given as an argument will be valid dates. That is, there will not be a date like February 31st.
