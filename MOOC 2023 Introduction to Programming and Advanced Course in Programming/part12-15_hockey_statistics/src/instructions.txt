"""
    rationale:
    create 3 classes: Player, PlayerDatabase, HockeyStatisticsApplication
    Player should contain the following data attributes and should all be encapsulated and can't be manipulated:
      "name": "Travis Zajac",
      "nationality": "CAN",
      "assists": 16,
      "goals": 9,
      "penalties": 28,
      "team": "NJD",
      "games": 69
      
    PlayerDatabase is a database that includes objects of type Player.
    It should have the following functionalities:
        - player search
        - teams
        - countries
        - players in teams
        - players from country
        - most points
        - most goals
    
    HockeyStatisticsApplication should be the only place where we handle user input.
    Once this is called we should instantly load all existing information from filename and import them as Players and into the PlayersDatabase
        - utilize "try-except" blocks when handling user inputs
