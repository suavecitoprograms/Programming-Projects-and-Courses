You have the CSV files from the previous exercise at your
disposal again.
Please write a function named final_points(), which returns 
the final
exam points received by the students, in a dictionary format, 
following
these criteria:

If there are multiple submissions for the same task, the
submission
with the highest number of points is taken into account.
If the submission was made over 3 hours after the start 
time,
the submission is ignored.
The tasks are numbered 1 to 8, and each submission is graded 
with 0 to 6 points.

In the dicionary returned the key should be the name of the
student, and the value the total points received by the 
student.

Hint: nested dictionaries might be a good approach when 
processing
the tasks and submission times of each student.
