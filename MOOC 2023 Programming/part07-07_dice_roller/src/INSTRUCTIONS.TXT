In this exercise you will write some functions which can be used in games
that involve dice.

Instead of normal dice this exercise specifies non-transitive dice.
You can read up on these here or watch this video.

You will use three dice:

Die A has the sides 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6
Die B has the sides 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5
Die C has the sides 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
Please write a function named roll(die: str), which rolls the die
specified by the argument. An example of how this should work:

for i in range(20):
    print(roll("A"), " ", end="")
print()
for i in range(20):
    print(roll("B"), " ", end="")
print()
for i in range(20):
    print(roll("C"), " ", end="")
Sample output
3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  6  3  6  3
2  2  5  2  2  5  5  2  2  5  2  5  5  5  2  5  2  2  2  2
4  4  4  4  4  1  1  4  4  4  1  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4
Also write a function named  play(die1: str, die2: str, times: int),
which throws both dice as many times as specified by the third argument.
The function should return a tuple. The first item should be the number
of times die 1 won, the second the number of times die 2 won, and the
third item should be the number of ties.

result = play("A", "C", 1000)
print(result)
result = play("B", "B", 1000)
print(result)
Sample output
(292, 708, 0)
(249, 273, 478)
