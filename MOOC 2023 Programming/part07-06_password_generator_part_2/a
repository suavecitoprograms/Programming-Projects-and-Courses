Please write an improved version of your password generator. The function now takes three arguments:

If the second argument is True, the generated password should also contain one or more numbers.
If the third argument is True, the generated password should also contain one or more of these special characters: !?=+-()#.
Despite these two additional arguments, the password should always contain at least one lowercase alphabet. You may assume the function will only be called with combinations of arguments that are possible to formulate into passwords following these rules. That is, the arguments will not specify e.g. a password of length 2 which contains both a number and a special characters, for then there would not be space for the mandatory lowercase letter.

An example of how the function should work:
